<P>In the culture of simulation, experiences on the Internet figure prominently. In cyberspac
  e, we can talk, exchange ideas, and assume personae of our own creation. In an interactive c
  omputer game inspired by Star Trek, thousands of players spend up to eighty hours a week par

    ritative than they really are and making their stories seem comprehensive and complete. Sli
    ckness in presentation works against the journalistic ideal of promoting intelligent citize
    n involvement in the political and social process by seeming to be so complete that nothing
     more can be said. The result is called the syndrome of well-informed futility. Readers, li
     steners and viewers feel satisfied that they‘re fully informed, which becomes an end in it
     self. This phenomenon works against democracy, which is predicated on citizen involvement,
      not apathy.</P>
